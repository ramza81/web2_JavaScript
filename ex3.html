        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted or JIT compiled programming
        language with
        first-class functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
        non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a
        prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented,
        imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about <span class="js">JavaScript</span>.
        This section of the site is dedicated to the <span class="js">JavaScript</span> language itself, and not the
        parts
        that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs specific
        to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
        The standard for <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is <span>ECMAScript</span>. As of 2012, all modern browsers
        fully support
        <span>ECMAScript</span> 5.1. Older browsers support at least <span>ECMAScript</span> 3. On June 17, 2015,
        ECMA International published the sixth major version of <span>ECMAScript</span>, <span>ECMAScript</span> 2015.
        Since then, <span>ECMAScript</span> standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to
        the latest draft version, which is currently <span>ECMAScript</span> 2019.
        Do not confuse <span class="js">JavaScript</span> with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "<span
            class="js">JavaScript</span>"
        are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries.
        However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and uses.
